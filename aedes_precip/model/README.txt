Note: the folder "rainfall_maricopa" should be placed in this folder (aedes > model) once the
github repository is downloaded locally.

We intend to place the data in a permanent repository, however, because of data limitations and 
"big data" issues, we believe the FigShare repository does not currently contain working raster files.

As a temporary workaround, please go to Dropbox folder:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9vnj7xx8znxpd8b/AAC0sWDQuas5Q34QD89i_i6ua?dl=0
and manually download the file rainfall_maricopa.tar.gz
This file is 7.7 GB and will be 9GB or larger once extracted.

Extract the file in this folder (aedes_precip > model), either by clicking on it
or by using the Terminal on Mac (or other Linux terminal). Change the working 
directory to the folder "model" and execute the command:

tar -xzf rainfall_maricopa.tar.gz
