# PART 1: Introduction
##########

# This code is used in the project:
# Newman, E.A.=, X. Feng=, K.R. Walker, S. Young, K. Smith, J. Townsend, 
# D. Damian, J. Soto, K. Ernst. 
# Precipitationâ€™s complicated role in driving the abundance of an 
# emerging disease vector in an urban, arid landscape

# The function provided in part 2 (and example data files) provide a method for linking organismal data
# with georeferenced information and dates to kriged precipitation data from the same area. The 
# date range of the kriged data to be associated with each individual observation of organismal data 
# can be specified by the user by modifying the code. Notes below.

# Examples of kriged layers of precipition data used in this study are available
# in folder "rainfall_maricopa". These are for visualization only, as the 
# code will only run if all trapping events can be associated with previous days' 
# precipitation at that exact location. The full set of rasters is provided as a zip file
# and if they are used, then the user should delete or rename folder "rainfall_maricopa" and
# unzip the file by a similar name in the "aedes_precip > model" folder.
# Data are also available for download at figshare.com at
## Newman, Erica; Feng, Xiao (2021): Maricopa County, AZ interpolated daily 
# precipitation rasters. 
## figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14068988.v1 
# (permanent repository)

# Note: these files are 12.5 MB as a .zip file, but will be larger than 9 GB 
# once unzipped.

# Users may need to manage working memory of their computers in order to run
# these analyses with these data; however, similar analyses with smaller 
# rasters should run comfortably on a 8GB memory computer.

# Data for trap location information ("blurred" to protect currently operating 
# machinery and personal addresses), and counts of male and female adults
# Aedes aegypti collected at those traps, with associated collection dates
# are available in the github repository as "Ae_aegypti_mosqcounts_blurred.csv"
# in the aedes_precip > model > R_data folder. Blurred data are provided as  
# location information rounded to 3 decimal places. 

# The file structure used for these analyses follow that of the "aedes_precip" 
# folder in this github repository.

# The code below should automatically choose to run the code and get data from the correct folders,
# however, the user may want to manually point the code to wherever the data are stored, either locally 
# or online. Navigating to RStudio menu: Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory, 
# and then selecting "Open" for the downloaded folder "maricopamosquitoes-master" will run
# a line of code that sets the correct local directory once the github directory is downloaded.
# Note that if the data from FigShare is used, it will have to be downloaded and unzipped into the 
# "aedes_precip > model" folder if used (see below), and the .dbf file in "R_data" 
# will need to be unzipped after the download of the github repository.

# A file structure that can be used if all of the data files are stored locally (i.e. 
# on a user's computer, github account, Dropbox folder or other cloud-based folder,
# or other pathway that can be accessed by the user directly)
# is the following:

# Project: Maricopa mosquitoes
# > aedes_precip
#    >> R_scripts
#      ## precip_function.R (this script)
#    >> model
#         >>> rainfall_maricopa_vis (for example and visualization purposes)
#             >>>> raw
#               ## (files in this folder are named "5400_FOPR_17.xlsx", etc., 
#                 and follow structure of the github folder)
#             >>>> 3_station_raster
#               ## (files in this folder are named "X20150319_ped.tif", etc., 
#                   and follow structure of the github folder)
#         ## rainfall_maricopa.zip (complete set of rasters that must be unzipped by user)
#         >>> R_data
#            ## occ_SPATIAL_proj.shp & associated files (large .dbf file must be unzipped by user)
#            ## Ae_aegypti_mosqcounts_blurred.csv for direct inquiry
#            ## df.csv used in Part 3 of this code (result of running code in Part 2)
